# firewall
Attaching a firewall to a network to block outgoing traffic.

## Project 1 Description
A company needs to restrict outgoing traffic from its server using a firewall. They want me to block users from visiting anything besides https://www.microsoft.com, and they don't want to allow port 53 outbound from the server. My task is to create a firewall and connect it to their virtual network as a solution.
